            <p id="edward-info"><b>Edward Robert Hughes</b> was a British painter, born in 1851, who is best known for his intricate watercolors, though he also produced notable oil paintings. He was influenced by his uncle, <b>Arthur Hughes</b>, a member associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Hughes studied at the Royal Academy Schools, where both Pre-Raphaelitism and Aestheticism left a significant mark on his artistic style.<br><br>While he initially began his career as a portrait painter for the upper class, he gained greater recognition for his imaginative works, including <b>Midsummer Eve</b> and <b>Night with her Train of Stars</b>.
                In addition to his own artistic pursuits, Hughes worked closely with William Holman Hunt, one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.<br>As Hunt’s assistant, Hughes contributed to several important works, particularly when Hunt’s eyesight began to fail due to glaucoma. Notably, he helped complete The Light of the World and The Lady of Shalott, earning recognition for his precise technique and dedication to detail.
                Hughes held respected positions in the artistic community, becoming a member of the Royal Watercolour Society (RWS) and serving as vice-president for a time. His work was exhibited in several prestigious London galleries, and today, his paintings are housed in prominent museums.<br><br>In 1913 he moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire, where he was later stricken with appendicitis. He died after surgery on 23 April 1914 in his home.</p>
